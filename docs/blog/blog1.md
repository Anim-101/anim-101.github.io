# Why I Chose React for My Portfolio

Reactâ€™s component-based architecture made it easy to build and maintain my personal portfolio. With reusable components and fast updates through the virtual DOM, React was a clear winner.

## Key Benefits

- Reusable components
- Fast rendering
- Great ecosystem

Building with React also helps me demonstrate real-world development skills on my GitHub portfolio.
