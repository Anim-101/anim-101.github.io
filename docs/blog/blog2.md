# Deploying React App to GitHub Pages

I used the `gh-pages` package to deploy my React app. It pushes the build to a `gh-pages` branch and makes it available under my GitHub Pages site.

## Steps

1. Install `gh-pages`
2. Add `homepage` to `package.json`
3. Add `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts
4. Run `npm run deploy`

GitHub Pages is a great option for hosting static React projects.
