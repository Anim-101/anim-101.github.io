# AEM Project Capabilities
In previous sections we have gone through basic to advanced authoring capabilities. What we have learned in those section were authoring capabilities. In this section we will go through some Project Capabilities in AEM to have good grasp about AEM Projects.

## AEM: Collaborate with Inbox
There are three different type of task that we can setup using Inbox. First of all we can setup a **Ad Hoc Task**. This is really very useful for a project. Using "Create Button" in the index, we can create this. Also it always not going to be assigned to a project, sometimes it can be assigned to random task.

Another one is, we can create **Project Task**. These are created in the Inbox and added directly to a project or already part of a project's task list. And last one is **Work Items**. Which is a part of a specific workflow. For example it can be an update asset workflow, or an approval workflow. So these are directly derived from workflow. And workflow will directly notify to the user.

## AEM: Use Calendaring
Calendar is part of inbox. We can change our inbox to view it in calendar mode. Then we will be able to see the status of each task there. Also task can be seen as divided as high or medium. When a task is marked yellow, we will need to complete this task as soon as possible.

There are also different view of calendars. And a quick action option available with omnisearch and filtering too. And these all of the functionalities are for end users and as a part of Inbox.

## AEM: Create and Use Project Masters
AEM projects are incredibly useful because they allow us to manage all of the features using just one interface. We can assign a participant in the workflow so that when it runs people get automatically assigned, we also can assign task in calendar mode with workflow and many more in a AEM project.

It generally makes everything manageable. We can see assets, we can see contents, all the experiences, everything related to the project. We have many many different pieces of website in a project. There is the website, there are all of the assets, there are forms, there are screens and many more in to. So using project we can setup team members and assign members depend on the task.

As project is useful, so are the roles. We can setup roles and replicate those in other projects in AEM. For example we can have *role_owner* *role_editor* *role_observer* as roles. Generally those might not be needed but in a project those role based user would be basic requirements.

So let's say we have Project A and Project Z. And anytime we create those project from Project Master then all of the user information and roles will be replicated in Project A & Project Z. Which means Project Master is really very important in case of replication and handling information to other replicated projects.

## Conclusion
Project capabilities do come from authoring of website. In this section we have tried to go through some of the important project capabilities. Which shall be elaborated in official documentation. it is just notes on my learning. Please proceed through the official video and documentation.
