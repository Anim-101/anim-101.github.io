# How I Added Dark Mode to My React Site

Dark mode enhances user experience and is easy to implement with Tailwind CSS and React state.

## Strategy

- Use `useState` to track theme
- Apply conditional Tailwind classes
- Save theme in `localStorage` to persist

Dark mode toggle gives users visual comfort, especially when browsing at night.
